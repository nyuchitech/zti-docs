# Volunteer Opportunities

Volunteering can be a meaningful way to contribute to Zimbabwe while gaining unique experiences. However, it's essential to approach volunteering ethically—ensuring your presence genuinely helps rather than inadvertently causing harm. This guide covers how to find legitimate opportunities and make a positive impact.

<Warning>
**Important:** Not all volunteer programs are ethical or effective. Some can actually harm the communities or wildlife they claim to help. Please read the "Ethical Volunteering" section carefully before committing to any program.
</Warning>

- Don't displace local workers
- Measure and share impact

**Red Flags:**

- Founded/run entirely by foreigners
- No local staff in leadership
- Vague about outcomes
</Card>

### Voluntourism Concerns

<Card title="When Volunteering Can Harm" icon="triangle-exclamation">

**Orphanage Tourism:**
- Creates demand for children to be in institutions
- Attachment issues from rotating caregivers
- Children kept in orphanages unnecessarily
- Often exploitative
- **Avoid all orphanage volunteering**

**Wildlife Interaction:**
- "Cub petting" often feeds canned hunting industry
- Walking with lions is not conservation
- Wild animals should remain wild
- Rehabilitation centers don't need unqualified help
- **Avoid programs with direct wild animal contact**

**Unskilled Work:**
- Building projects by unskilled volunteers may be poor quality
- Takes jobs from local workers
- Creates dependency
- May be demolished and rebuilt for next group
- **Question whether your skills are actually needed**

**Best Approach:**
- Apply your professional skills
- Support local organizations
- Consider donating money instead

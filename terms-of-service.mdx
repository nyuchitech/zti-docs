## 11. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Zimbabwe, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 12. Dispute Resolution

Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Centre of Zimbabwe, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

## 13. Severability

- Stay quiet and minimize movements
- Follow guide instructions immediately
- Support anti-poaching through responsible tourism

- Photography safaris (observe, don't interact)

## Supporting Local Communities

**Direct Support:**

- **Eat at local restaurants** (support local businesses)
- **Use local tour operators** (not foreign-owned only)

**CAMPFIRE Areas:**

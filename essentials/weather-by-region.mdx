# Weather by Region

Zimbabwe's climate varies significantly by region and altitude. This guide provides detailed weather information to help you plan your visit and pack appropriately.

<Note>
**General Rule:** Zimbabwe sits on a high plateau (1,200-1,600m), giving it a more moderate climate than you might expect from a tropical African country. The Eastern Highlands are cooler and wetter, while the lowveld areas are hotter and drier.
</Note>

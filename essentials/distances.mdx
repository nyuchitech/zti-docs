<Tip>
  **Distance Planning Tip**: When using GPS or mapping apps in Zimbabwe, always cross-reference with local advice. Road conditions change frequently, and the fastest route on a map may not be the most practical. Download offline maps before traveling, as mobile signal is limited in many areas.

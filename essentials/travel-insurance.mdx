## Why Zimbabwe Requires Special Insurance

**Remote Locations:**
- Safari lodges hours from hospitals
- Limited medical facilities outside major cities
- Evacuation by air often necessary
- Nearest advanced care: South Africa (1+ hours by air)

**Adventure Activities:**
- White water rafting
- Bungee jumping (111m Victoria Falls bridge)
- Gorge swinging and zip-lining
- Canoeing safaris
- Walking safaris
- Many standard policies EXCLUDE these

**Wildlife Risks:**
- Animal encounters (rare but possible)
- Snake bites (medical evacuation essential)
- Insect-borne diseases (malaria, though preventable)

**Investment Protection:**
- Safari lodges expensive ($300-1,500/night)
- Usually prepaid months in advance
- Non-refundable deposits
- Cancellation for any reason valuable

## Essential Coverage Types

### 1. Medical Evacuation (MOST CRITICAL)

**What It Covers:**
- Emergency medical evacuation from remote areas
- Air ambulance to Harare or South Africa
- Ground ambulance to nearest facility
- Repatriation to home country if necessary
- Medical escort if required

**Why Essential:**
- Remote safari camps lack advanced medical care
- Serious injury/illness requires evacuation
- Evacuation costs $20,000-100,000+ without insurance
- Lodges can arrange evacuation but YOU pay without insurance

**Minimum Coverage:** $100,000 (recommended: $250,000+)

**Real Example:**
Tourist has heart attack at Hwange safari lodge. Air ambulance to Johannesburg costs $85,000. Without insurance, pays out of pocket. WITH insurance, covered fully.

**Ask Provider:**

## FAQs

**Q: Can I buy insurance if I'm already in Zimbabwe?**
A: World Nomads allows mid-trip purchase, but coverage limited (no trip cancellation). Best to buy before departure.

**Q: Do I need insurance if I have health insurance at home?**
A: YES! Most domestic health insurance doesn't cover international travel, and NONE cover medical evacuation. Travel insurance essential.

**Q: Will credit card insurance cover me?**
A: Credit card insurance often minimal and excludes adventure activities. Usually inadequate for Zimbabwe safari. Get dedicated travel insurance.

**Q: Is travel insurance required to enter Zimbabwe?**
A: Not legally required, but HIGHLY recommended. Some lodges may ask if you have coverage.

**Q: What if I need to cancel because of work?**
A: Standard policies rarely cover work conflicts. Cancel for any reason (CFAR) would cover this at 50-75% reimbursement.

**Q: How do I know if bungee/rafting is covered?**
A: Call provider BEFORE purchasing and ask explicitly. Get written confirmation. Many standard policies exclude these.

**Q: Can I extend my policy while traveling?**
A: World Nomads allows extensions. Most others require returning home first. Check policy terms.

**Q: What if I get malaria?**
A: Treatment covered if you took prescribed prophylaxis. Document that you took preventative measures.

**Q: Does insurance cover evacuation from anywhere?**
A: Evacuation to nearest adequate medical facility covered. Remote safari lodges would evacuate to Harare or South Africa - covered.

**Critical Reminder:**

Don't travel to Zimbabwe without comprehensive insurance including:
1. ✅ Medical coverage ($100,000+ minimum)
2. ✅ Emergency evacuation ($100,000+ minimum)
3. ✅ Adventure activity coverage (if doing Victoria Falls activities)
4. ✅ Trip cancellation (covers your trip cost)
5. ✅ 24/7 emergency assistance

The $200-400 you spend on insurance is nothing compared to the $50,000+ medical evacuation bill or losing your $10,000 safari investment.

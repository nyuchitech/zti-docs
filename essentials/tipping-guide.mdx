# Tipping Guide

Tipping in Zimbabwe is appreciated and expected in many situations, especially in tourism. This guide covers who to tip, how much, and the cultural etiquette around gratuities.

<Note>
**Currency for Tips:** Always tip in US Dollars (USD). Small denominations ($1, $5, $10, $20) are essential. Bring plenty of small bills from home as change can be difficult to obtain.
</Note>

## Safari Tipping

### Safari Guides

<Card>
**Your Guide is Key:**
Safari guides make or break your experience. They work long hours, possess extensive knowledge, and ensure your safety. Tipping well is both customary and appreciated.

**Recommended Amounts:**

| Guide Type | Per Person/Day | For 2 People/Day |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Standard** | $10-15 | $20-30 |
| **Excellent** | $15-20 | $30-40 |
| **Exceptional** | $20-25+ | $40-50+ |

**Private vs. Shared:**
- **Private guide** (exclusive to your group): Higher end of range
- **Shared guide** (multiple parties): Standard range

**When to Tip:**
- At the end of your stay at each lodge
- Give directly to the guide in an envelope
- A personal thank you alongside the tip is meaningful

**Additional Considerations:**
- Walking safari guides often get higher tips (more skill required)
- Multi-day guides: Tip at the end of the full safari
- If guide went above and beyond, tip accordingly
</Card>

### Trackers & Spotters

<Card>
**Often Overlooked:**
Trackers work incredibly hard, often starting before dawn to locate wildlife. They're essential to your safari success.

**Recommended:**
- $5-10 per person per day
- Half of what you tip the guide
- Give separately from guide tip

**Note:** Some operations pool tracker tips with staff; ask your lodge about their policy.
</Card>

### Safari Lodge Staff

<Card>
**Staff Gratuity Pool:**
Most safari lodges have a staff tip pool that's divided among:
- Housekeeping
- Kitchen staff
- Waitstaff
- Grounds staff
- Behind-the-scenes employees

**Recommended:**
- $10-15 per person per day
- Leave at the end of your stay
- Most lodges have a "Staff Gratuity" box or envelope system

**Example Calculation:**
- 3-night stay for 2 people at $15/person/day = $90 total for staff pool

**Personal Tips:**
If someone provided exceptional individual service (butler, specific waiter), you may tip them directly in addition to the staff pool.
</Card>

### Mobile & Camping Safaris

<Card>
**Camping Safari Tips:**

| Role | Per Person/Day |
|------|---------------|
| **Guide/Driver** | $15-20 |
| **Camp Staff** (cook, assistant) | $10-15 |
| **Porter** (if applicable) | $5-10 |

For small-group camping safaris, the team is smaller but works harder. Budget accordingly.
</Card>

## How to Give Tips

<Card title="Tipping Etiquette" icon="hand-holding-dollar">

**Methods:**

**Etiquette:**

- Make eye contact and thank the person
- For safari guides, a few words of appreciation mean a lot
- Don't make a show of tipping

**Timing:**
- Service staff: At time of service
- Safari guides/lodge staff: End of stay at that lodge
- Drivers: End of trip
- Restaurant: When paying bill

**Envelopes:**
Safari lodges often provide tip envelopes. If not:
- Simple envelope is fine
- Write recipient's name or "Safari Guide"
- Seal it for privacy
</Card>

## Budgeting for Tips

<Card title="Planning Your Tip Budget" icon="calculator">

**Sample Tip Budget (7-Day Safari Trip, 2 People):**

| Safari guides | $15/person × 7 days × 2 | $210 |
| Lodge staff | $12/person × 7 days × 2 | $168 |
| Trackers | $7/person × 5 days × 2 | $70 |

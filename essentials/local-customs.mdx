## Greetings

### The Importance of Greetings

<Card title="Greetings Matter" icon="hand-wave">

In Zimbabwean culture, greetings are fundamental to social interaction. Taking time to greet people properly is considered essential—rushing past without greeting is seen as rude.

**Key Points:**
- Always greet before any conversation or transaction
- Take your time; greetings shouldn't be rushed
- Ask about health, family, sleep—even from strangers
- Not greeting is considered disrespectful

**Common Greeting Pattern:**
1. Initial greeting (Good morning/afternoon)
2. "How are you?"
3. "How did you sleep?" (morning) or "How is your day?"
4. "How is the family?"
5. Only then proceed to business

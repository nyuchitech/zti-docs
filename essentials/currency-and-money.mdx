# Money in Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe has a complex monetary system that has evolved through years of economic challenges. Understanding the current currency situation and payment options will help you manage your finances effectively during your visit.

## Current Currency Situation

Zimbabwe's currency landscape has undergone significant changes in recent years:

<Accordion icon="money-bill" title="Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG)">
  In April 2024, Zimbabwe introduced a new currency called the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), replacing the Zimbabwe Dollar (ZWL). Key points about the ZiG:

  * Backed by gold and other precious metal reserves

  * Currency code: ZWG

  * Available as both notes and coins

  * Exchange rates more stable than previous currencies

  * Most businesses accept ZiG for goods and services

  **Note**: As this is a relatively new currency, the situation may evolve. Check the latest updates before your trip.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="US Dollar (USD)">
  The US Dollar remains widely used throughout Zimbabwe:

  * Officially recognized for transactions

  * Preferred currency for tourism services (hotels, tours, national parks)

  * Accepted almost everywhere, including small businesses and rural areas

  * Often receives better pricing than local currency payments

  * Main currency for high-value transactions

  **Tip**: The US Dollar is still the most reliable currency to carry in Zimbabwe.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="globe" title="Other Foreign Currencies">
  While the US Dollar dominates, other foreign currencies have limited acceptance:

  * South African Rand (ZAR): Widely accepted in southern Zimbabwe and border areas

  * Euro (EUR): Accepted at major hotels and tourism businesses

  * British Pound (GBP): Limited acceptance in tourism establishments

  * Botswana Pula (BWP): Accepted near the Botswana border

  Exchange rates for these currencies are typically less favorable than for USD.
</Accordion>

## Payment Methods

### Cash Payments

<Card>
  Cash remains the most reliable payment method in Zimbabwe, especially outside major cities:

  **US Dollar Notes:**

  * Bring clean, newer bills printed after 2009

  * Small denominations ($1, $5, $10, $20) highly valuable

  * $50 and $100 bills sometimes difficult to use

  * Counterfeit detection markers often used for larger bills

  **Local Currency (ZiG):**

  * Useful for small purchases, markets, and public transport

  * Obtain from official banks and exchange offices only

  * Exchange rates can fluctuate

  * Consider changing small amounts frequently rather than large sums

  **Change Issues:**

  * Change shortages are common; exact amounts appreciated

  * Small USD bills ($1-$5) often used as change

  * Sometimes change given in local currency even for USD payments
</Card>

### Card Payments

<Card>
  Card acceptance is improving but still limited:

  **Credit/Debit Cards:**

  * Visa and Mastercard accepted at major hotels, restaurants, and upscale establishments

  * AmEx and other cards have very limited acceptance

  * International transaction fees often apply (check with your bank)

  * Sometimes incur additional local surcharges

  * Many businesses require minimum purchase amounts

  * Network connectivity issues can affect processing

  **Mobile Payments:**

  * Increasingly common, especially in urban areas

  * Services include EcoCash, OneMoney, and Telecash

  * Require local mobile number and registration

  * Not practical for most short-term visitors

  **Contactless Payments:**

  * Limited but growing in large supermarkets and hotels

  * Apple Pay and Google Pay have minimal acceptance
</Card>

  * Rural areas have very limited or no ATM access

  **Withdrawal Limits:**

  * Higher reliability at ATMs in major hotels and shopping centers

## Do
</div>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Wear neutral colours">
    Animals notice bright colours, which can distract them or even make them leave.
    
    In addition to this, tsetse flies are attracted to blue and black clothing.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Pack for a range of conditions">
    Zimbabwe is close to the equator, so weather can be a bit unpredictable. It always pays to have a raincoat and some warm clothes in case it gets cold overnight.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Look after your valuables">
    Theft is not usually a problem out on safari, but it pays to keep a close eye on your phone, wallet, passport, camera etc. when you're not in your vehicle.
    
    Always lock your hotel room and/or keep your valuables on your person.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Remember you're in Africa">
    Zimbabwe has made great strides towards being a modern nation, but you'll still encounter 'first world problems' like lack of WiFi, intermittent electricity overnight, and the occasional creepy crawly. Just remember, "TIA - This is Africa".

  <Card title="Tip appropriately">
    It is customary to tip your safari driver approximately $20 USD per group per day. Your chef or trekking porter will usually be tipped $15 USD per day.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Bring mosquito repellent and sunscreen">
    Mosquitos and tsetse flies can be an annoyance while on safari, and both can carry diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Bring some insect repellent along with you.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Bring some cash with you">
    Tipping, souvenir shopping, and buying alcoholic beverages are things you might want to have some extra cash for.
    
    Most places in Zimbabwe will accept either Zimbabwe Dollars or US dollars, and larger hotels will have credit card payment as an option.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Stay hydrated">
    It's important to drink plenty of water while on safari. Your safari vehicle will always have plenty of water on board.

  <Card title="Wake up early">
    The best time to see Africa's wildlife is early in the morning and late in the day, as the heat makes animals lethargic.
    
    Dawn game drives are an unforgettable experience.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Take lots of photos">
    Taking photos of Zimbabwe's wildlife is encouraged! Snap as many as you can!

<div className="section-title">
## Don't
</div>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Feed the animals">
    These are wild animals, and we'd like them to stay that way!
    
    Not only is feeding the animals dangerous to you, but it's also bad for the animals - as it teaches them to approach people rather than to hunt for their own food.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Photograph people without asking">
    Like anywhere else in the world, it is considered rude to take a person's photograph without asking.
    
    Be careful even when asking permission, as some will try to charge you for taking a photo of or with them.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Call out to animals or talk loudly">
    Not only does this actually scare the animals away, it's also incredibly rude to other people on safari.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Approach the animals">
    These are wild animals that hunt and kill their food. Even the herbivores have a kill or be killed approach when frightened.
    
    Never approach a wild animal.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Leave your vehicle or camp unaccompanied">
    Unless you're accompanied by your guide or a staff member at your lodge, you should never wander around outdoors unaccompanied.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Litter">
    Keep your trash with you in the car. The national parks of Zimbabwe are to be kept as you found them.
  </Card>

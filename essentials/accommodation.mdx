**Accommodation Advice**: When booking safari accommodations, ask about the specific location and habitat. Waterhole-facing rooms often provide 24-hour wildlife viewing, while rooms overlooking rivers may offer more diverse scenery but fewer animal sightings. River views in Mana Pools or Zambezi area accommodations are particularly spectacular.

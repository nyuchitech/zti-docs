## History

### Rise of the Torwa Dynasty

After the decline of Great Zimbabwe around 1450 AD, power shifted westward. The Torwa dynasty established Khami as the capital of what became known as the Butua State. Unlike Great Zimbabwe which was built on flat ground, Khami's builders chose to construct on natural granite hills, incorporating the landscape into their architecture.

### Architectural Innovation

Khami represents an evolution in building techniques:
- **Terracing** - Walls built as retaining structures for artificial platforms
- **Decoration** - Distinctive checkered, herringbone, and cord patterns
- **Integration** - Natural rock outcrops incorporated into structures
- **Drainage** - Sophisticated systems to manage water runoff

### International Trade

Archaeological evidence reveals extensive trade networks:
- **Chinese porcelain** from the Ming Dynasty
- **Spanish coins** and trade goods
- **German beads** from European traders
- **Gold objects** and copper ingots
- **Portuguese trade items** suggesting contact with explorers

A small cross found at the site may indicate early contact with Portuguese missionaries, predating official records.

### Decline

Khami was destroyed by fire around 1683 during conflicts with the Rozvi dynasty under Changamire Dombo. The Rozvi subsequently established their capital at Danangombe (Dhlo Dhlo).

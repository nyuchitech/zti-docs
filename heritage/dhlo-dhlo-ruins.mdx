## Historical Significance

### Capital of the Rozvi

Danangombe became the capital of the Rozvi Empire after Changamire Dombo destroyed Khami around 1683. From here, the Rozvi controlled:

- Much of the Zimbabwe plateau
- Important gold-producing regions
- Trade routes to the coast
- Tributary states and chieftaincies

### The Changamire Dynasty

The Rozvi emperors, known by the dynastic title **Changamire**, ruled from Danangombe for approximately 150 years. The empire was renowned for:

- **Military Power** - The Rozvi army was feared throughout the region
- **Cattle Wealth** - Vast herds were a measure of royal power
- **Stone Architecture** - Continued the building traditions of Great Zimbabwe
- **Religious Authority** - Controlled the Mwari oracle at Matobo

### The Fall of the Rozvi

The Rozvi Empire met its end during the Mfecane period (1820s-1830s) when:
1. Nguni groups fleeing Shaka Zulu's wars invaded
2. Nxaba's Nguni attacked Rozvi settlements
3. Mzilikazi's Ndebele forces completed the conquest
4. The last Changamire was killed, ending the dynasty

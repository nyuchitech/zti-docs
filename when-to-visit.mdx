## Zimbabwe's Seasons

Zimbabwe's climate follows four main seasons:

    * **Wildlife viewing**: Animals more dispersed due to plentiful water sources

    * **Victoria Falls**: Water levels begin rising in January, reaching peak flow by March-April

## Best Time to Visit by Activity

The ideal time for your visit depends on your primary interests:

### Wildlife Safaris

<Card>
  **Best: May to October**

  The dry season concentrates wildlife around water sources, making animals easier to spot. September and October offer the most dramatic wildlife sightings, though temperatures can be extremely hot.

  **Alternative: April**

  Still good wildlife viewing with more comfortable temperatures and greener landscapes.
</Card>

### Victoria Falls

<Card>
  **For maximum water flow: February to May**

  The falls are at their most powerful, creating a spectacular thunder and drenching spray. However, visibility of the actual falls can be limited due to the heavy mist.

  **For better visibility: June to August**

  Water levels are still impressive but reduced enough to see more of the falls and enjoy activities like swimming in Devil's Pool (Zambian side).

  **For rock face views: September to November**

  Water flow is at its lowest, particularly on the Zimbabwean side, allowing you to see the full rock structure.
</Card>

### Hiking and Outdoor Activities

<Card>
  **Best: April to September**

  Comfortable temperatures and dry conditions make this ideal for hiking in the Eastern Highlands, exploring Matobo Hills, or walking safaris.

  **Avoid: October** (unless you handle heat well)

  Extremely hot temperatures can make outdoor activities uncomfortable.
</Card>

### White Water Rafting

<Card>
  **Low-water season (best rafting): August to December**

  As water levels drop, more rapids are exposed, creating more exciting rafting conditions on the Zambezi.

  **High-water season (limited rafting): January to July**

  Some sections may be closed when water levels are too high.
</Card>

### Photography

<Card>
  **Landscape photography: April to May**

  Landscapes are still green, skies are clear, and Victoria Falls is at peak flow.

  **Wildlife photography: June to October**

  Better wildlife viewing and interesting interactions around water sources.

  **Bird photography: November to April**

  Migratory birds are present and many species are in breeding plumage.
</Card>

## Budget Considerations

<Warning>
  Zimbabwe has distinct high and low seasons that affect pricing:

  * **High season (July to October)**: Accommodations and tours can be 30-50% more expensive than low season

  * **Shoulder season (May to June, November)**: Good value with still-favorable conditions

  * **Low season (December to April)**: Best prices but with rainy season limitations
</Warning>

## When to Avoid

Consider avoiding:

* **Late October**: Extreme heat can reach uncomfortable levels, especially in lower-elevation areas

* **January to February**: Heavy rains can limit accessibility in some remote areas

* **Public holidays and school breaks**: Accommodation availability can be limited, especially around Christmas and New Year

***

<Tip>
  **Our recommendation**: For first-time visitors wanting a balance of experiences, **May to July** offers an excellent compromise with peak Victoria Falls flow, good wildlife viewing, comfortable temperatures, and reasonable prices.

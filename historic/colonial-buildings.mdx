# Colonial Architecture & Historic Buildings

<img src="/images/historic/colonial-architecture-zimbabwe.jpg" alt="Colonial era building in Zimbabwe" />

Zimbabwe's colonial period (1890-1980) left a significant architectural legacy across the country. From the grand public buildings of Harare and Bulawayo to remote mission stations and mining towns, these structures tell the story of the colonial era and its impact on Zimbabwe.

<Info>
**Context Matters** - Colonial architecture represents a complex heritage. These buildings were often built using forced labor and served systems of racial oppression. Understanding this context enriches rather than diminishes their historical significance.

## Understanding the Heritage

### Multiple Perspectives

Colonial architecture can be viewed from many angles:

**As History:**
- Documents the colonial period
- Shows aspirations and realities
- Preserves craftsmanship

**As Critique:**
- Built on dispossession
- Served segregated society
- Represents oppressive era

**As Resource:**
- Tourism asset
- Functional buildings
- Architectural education

**As Identity:**
- Complex relationship to present
- Neither celebrated nor erased
- Part of national story

<Card title="Complex Heritage" icon="building">
Colonial buildings are neither heroes nor villains - they're historical documents in stone. The grand hotels and railway stations tell stories of privilege and aspiration, while the workers' compounds nearby tell different stories entirely. Understanding both makes for richer visits.

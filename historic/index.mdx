# Historic Sites of Zimbabwe

<img src="/images/historic/zimbabwe-historic-sites.jpg" alt="Historic building in Zimbabwe" />

Zimbabwe's history stretches from ancient stone kingdoms to colonial occupation to hard-won independence. Beyond the famous stone ruins, the country preserves important sites from the colonial era, the liberation struggle, and the journey to nationhood.

<Info>
**Living History** - Many historic sites are still actively used, from working mission stations to government buildings. Zimbabwe's history is not just preserved - it's lived.

## Conservation and Controversy

Historic sites in Zimbabwe can be politically sensitive. Be aware that:

- Some colonial monuments have been removed or renamed
- Liberation war narratives may be one-sided
- Sacred sites require cultural sensitivity
- Photography may be restricted at some locations

<Card title="Complex History" icon="book-open">
Zimbabwe's history involves many perspectives - African kingdoms, colonial occupation, liberation struggle, and modern nation-building. The most meaningful visits engage with this complexity rather than oversimplifying.

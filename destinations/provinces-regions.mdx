## Understanding Zimbabwe's Regions

**Cultural Divide:**
Zimbabwe's provinces roughly follow the historical Shona-Ndebele cultural divide:
- **Mashonaland provinces:** Predominantly Shona people (about 70% of population)
- **Matabeleland provinces:** Predominantly Ndebele people (about 16% of population)

This influences language, traditions, food, and local customs. Travelers benefit from learning basic greetings in both languages.

**Economic Patterns:**
- **Agricultural heartland:** Mashonaland provinces
- **Mining regions:** Midlands, parts of Mashonaland Central
- **Tourism-dependent:** Victoria Falls, Hwange, Kariba
- **Conservation areas:** Throughout, but concentrated in Matabeleland North

**Tourism Development:**
- **Well-developed:** Victoria Falls, Hwange, Kariba
- **Developing:** Eastern Highlands, Matobo, Harare
- **Emerging:** Gonarezhou, secondary destinations
- **Frontier:** Remote areas in all provinces

---

<Tip>
**Provincial Travel Tip:** Don't skip provinces thinking they're "just transit." Each province has unique attractions, and some of Zimbabwe's best experiences are in lesser-visited areas. Ask locals about hidden gems - they know their province best!
</Tip>

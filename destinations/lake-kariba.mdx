<Tip>
  **Kariba Insider Tip**: Request a stop at the partially submerged "Big Tree" - a massive drowned baobab that stands as a haunting reminder of the valley before the lake formed. Located near Fothergill Island, it's a photographer's dream at sunset when fish eagles often perch on its branches, and it provides perspective on the enormous transformation this landscape underwent when the valley was flooded.

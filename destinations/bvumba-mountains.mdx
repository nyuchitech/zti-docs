<Tip>
  **Insider Tip**: Don't be discouraged by mist - it's part of the Bvumba's charm. Some of the most magical moments happen when clouds part briefly to reveal stunning views. The White Horse Inn's Sunday lunch is legendary, but book well ahead. For the best forest birding, stay at Eden Lodge and arrange an early morning guide.

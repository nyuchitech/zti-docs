<Tip>
  **Matusadona Insider Tip**: For the ultimate experience, time your visit to coincide with the full moon. The moonlit lake creates magical night photography opportunities, and many animals are more active during bright moonlit nights. Several lodges offer special full-moon packages with night boat cruises and romantic dinners on floating platforms.

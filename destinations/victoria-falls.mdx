## When to Visit

Victoria Falls changes dramatically with the seasons:

<Accordion icon="cloud-showers-heavy" title="High Water Season (February to July)">
  The falls are at their most powerful, with maximum water flow typically in April and May. Expect to get drenched on the walking paths, with some viewpoints obscured by heavy spray. The sheer volume and force of the falls during this time is incomparable.

  **Best for**: Experiencing the falls at their most dramatic, photography of the massive spray column, rainbows
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="water" title="Transitional Periods (January-February, July-August)">
  Water levels are moderate, offering a balance between impressive water flow and visibility of the rock face.

  **Best for**: Balanced experience with good photography without excessive spray
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="mountain" title="Low Water Season (September to December)">
  Water flow is significantly reduced, especially in October-November when parts of the falls (particularly on the Zambian side) may dry up completely. However, this allows you to see the full geological structure and the impressive gorge.

  **Best for**: Clear views of the falls' structure, swimming in Devil's Pool (Zambian side), white water rafting

### Remarkable Landscapes

<Card>
  The distinctive geological formations of Matobo were formed over 2 billion years ago, with granite weathering into extraordinary shapes:

  These formations, called kopjes (pronounced "ko-pee"), are arranged in a sea of domes and valleys, creating a landscape unlike any other in Africa.
</Card>

### Rock Art and Ancient History

  Matobo contains over 3,000 documented rock art sites, with the highest concentration in southern Africa:

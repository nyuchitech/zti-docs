***

<Tip>
  **Gonarezhou Insider Tip**: The hidden gem of the park is the Tambohata Pan in the northern section, which is one of the few permanent water sources during the dry season. Arrive at dawn and position your vehicle patiently on the eastern side (for optimal light) to witness a parade of wildlife coming to drink throughout the morning. During peak dry season, you might see elephant herds, buffalo, various antelope species, and occasionally predators all within a few hours.

# Mana Pools National Park

![Elephants in Mana Pools](/images/destinations/mana-pools/elephants-eating.jpg)

Mana Pools National Park is a remote wilderness sanctuary along the Zambezi River in northern Zimbabwe. This UNESCO World Heritage site and core of a larger biosphere reserve encompasses 2,196 square kilometers (848 square miles) of floodplains, riverine forests, and baobab-studded savanna.

The name "Mana" means "four" in the local Shona language, referring to the four main pools (Long, Chine, Chisambuk, and Mana) that remain from ancient river channels. These permanent water sources attract incredible concentrations of wildlife, especially during the dry season.

## Conservation Challenges

Mana Pools faces several conservation issues:

* **Climate change**: Altering seasonal patterns and water availability

* **Poaching pressure**: Particularly on elephant and other valuable species

* **Balancing tourism**: Maintaining wilderness character while allowing access

* **Human-wildlife conflict**: In surrounding communal areas

Many lodges contribute to conservation and anti-poaching initiatives. Ask about their projects and how you can support them during your stay.

***

<Warning>
  **Wilderness Safety**: Mana Pools is a true wilderness with inherent risks. Wildlife moves freely through all areas, including camps. Always maintain awareness, follow safety briefings, and if self-driving or walking independently, ensure you have sufficient experience and knowledge of wildlife behavior.

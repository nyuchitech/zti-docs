<Tip>
**The Hidden Gem Philosophy:**
The best hidden gems aren't on any list - they're discoveries you make yourself. Use this guide as a starting point, but the real treasures come from staying longer, asking more questions, and following the roads less traveled.

Every village has a story. Every valley has a secret. The adventure begins where the guidebook ends.
</Tip>

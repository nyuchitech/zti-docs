# Lake Chivero Recreational Park

![Lake Chivero](/images/destinations/lake-chivero/lake-view.jpg)

Lake Chivero (formerly Lake McIlwaine) is Harare's backyard wilderness - a recreational park combining wildlife viewing, water activities, and excellent birding just 32 kilometers from the capital. Created in 1952 when the Hunyani River was dammed to supply Harare's water, the lake and surrounding park have become a vital green space for both wildlife and weekend-escaping city dwellers.

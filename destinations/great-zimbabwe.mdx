# Great Zimbabwe

![Great Zimbabwe stone ruins](/images/hero-light.svg)

Great Zimbabwe is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the largest ancient stone construction in sub-Saharan Africa. This remarkable archaeological site gives Zimbabwe its name (literally meaning "houses of stone") and stands as a testament to the advanced civilization that flourished here between the 11th and 15th centuries.

## Historical Significance

The monumental stone city of Great Zimbabwe was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, which controlled trade throughout the region during the African Iron Age. At its peak in the late 14th century, it housed around 18,000 people and was the center of a trading network that extended to China and Persia.

<Info>
  For centuries, colonial narratives attempted to attribute these impressive structures to non-African civilizations. Today, it is firmly established that Great Zimbabwe was built by ancestors of the Shona people and represents one of Africa's most important archaeological treasures.
</Info>

## Main Features of the Site

Great Zimbabwe covers nearly 800 hectares (1,977 acres) and consists of three main architectural zones:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hill Complex" icon="mountain">
    The oldest part of the ruins, perched dramatically on a hill with stunning views. Believed to have been a royal residence and religious center. Features include the Eastern Enclosure and numerous small enclosures connected by narrow, winding passages.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Great Enclosure" icon="building-columns">
    The most impressive structure, featuring massive curved walls up to 11 meters (36 feet) high and 250 meters (820 feet) in circumference. Contains the famous Conical Tower, a solid stone structure 10 meters tall whose purpose remains debated. This area likely housed the elite of Great Zimbabwe.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Valley Ruins" icon="valley">
    A series of living compounds spread between the Hill Complex and Great Enclosure where most of the population lived. Reveals how the settlement expanded over time as the kingdom grew in wealth and power.

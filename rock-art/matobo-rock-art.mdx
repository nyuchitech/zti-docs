# Matobo Hills Rock Art

<img src="/images/rock-art/matobo-hills-paintings.jpg" alt="San rock paintings in Matobo Hills" />

The Matobo Hills contain the **highest concentration of rock art in the world**, with over 3,000 documented painted sites. This extraordinary gallery of San (Bushmen) art was one of the key reasons for the Matobo's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.

<Info>
**UNESCO Recognition** - The Matobo Hills were inscribed as a World Heritage Site partly because they "contain outstanding collections of rock art and the large number of rock art sites in a comparatively small area makes the hills an exceptional repository of the artistic tradition."
</Info>

## Understanding the Art

### Dating the Paintings

| Method | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|
| **Relative dating** | Superimposition (newer over older) |
| **Style analysis** | Changes in technique over time |
| **Archaeological context** | Associated deposits |
| **AMS radiocarbon** | Direct dating (limited) |

Most paintings are **2,000-5,000 years old**, though some may be 13,000+ years old and others as recent as 200 years ago.

### The Trance Hypothesis

The dominant interpretation of San rock art:

1. **Shamanic healers** entered trance through dancing
2. **Visions** experienced during trance were painted
3. **Power animals** (especially eland) featured prominently
4. **Transformation** (human to animal) depicted
5. **Entoptic phenomena** (geometric patterns) recorded

This interpretation comes from:
- Ethnographic records of San peoples
- Comparison with /Xam San oral traditions
- Analysis of painting content
- Neuropsychological research

### Reading a Panel

When viewing rock art, look for:

1. **Layers** - Older paintings underneath newer
2. **Groupings** - Related figures together
3. **Action** - What's happening in the scene
4. **Unusual features** - Lines from heads, bent postures
5. **Context** - Why this location?

## Connecting to Wildlife

Part of the magic of Matobo is seeing animals depicted in rock art alongside their living descendants:

| Animal | Painting Sites | Living in Park? |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Kudu | Many | Yes, common |
| Giraffe | Nswatugi | No (extirpated) |
| Eland | Several | Yes, rare |
| Leopard | A few | Yes, elusive |
| Baboon | Many | Yes, common |
| White rhino | White Rhino Shelter | Yes (reintroduced) |

Seeing a kudu silhouetted on a rock, then viewing 2,000-year-old paintings of kudu, creates a powerful connection to the San artists who lived here.

<Card title="Living Art" icon="palette">
Rock art sites are not museums - they're places where ancestors communicated with spirits, where rain was called, and where the power of the hunt was invoked. When you stand in Nswatugi Cave, you're in a space that was sacred for thousands of years.

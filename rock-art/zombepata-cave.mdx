Unusual use of white pigment for zebras:

## The Zombepata Experience

What visitors say:

*"The porcupine alone is worth the journey - I've seen hundreds of rock art sites and never seen anything like it."*

*"The formlings here are clearer than anywhere else. If you want to understand these mysterious shapes, you have to see Zombepata."*

*"It's not easy to get here, but that's part of what makes it special. This is real discovery."*

<Card title="Artistic Anomaly" icon="star">
Zombepata challenges our understanding of San rock art. Why paint a porcupine? Why white zebras? Why are the finest formlings here rather than in Matobo? These questions make Zombepata not just beautiful but intellectually fascinating.

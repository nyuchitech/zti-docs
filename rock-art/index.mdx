# Rock Art of Zimbabwe

<img src="/images/rock-art/zimbabwe-rock-art-main.jpg" alt="San rock art painting Zimbabwe" />

Zimbabwe possesses one of the **richest concentrations of rock art in the world**. Thousands of painted sites scattered across the country preserve a visual record spanning at least 13,000 years, created primarily by the San (Bushmen) hunter-gatherers who once inhabited this region.

<Info>
**World-Class Heritage** - The Matobo Hills alone contains over 3,000 documented rock art sites, earning it UNESCO World Heritage status partly for this extraordinary concentration of ancient paintings.

## The Artists: San People

### Who Were the San?

The San (also known as Bushmen or Basarwa) were the original inhabitants of southern Africa, living as hunter-gatherers for thousands of years before Bantu-speaking peoples arrived.

**San Society:**
- Egalitarian social structure
- Nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle
- Rich spiritual traditions
- Deep knowledge of the natural world
- Trance healing practices central to spiritual life

### Why Did They Paint?

The paintings were not merely decorative - they were deeply spiritual:

| Theory | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trance/Shamanic** | Paintings record visions seen during healing trances |
| **Power Capture** | Capturing the spiritual power of animals |
| **Teaching** | Recording knowledge for future generations |
| **Ritual** | Part of rain-making and other ceremonies |
| **Narrative** | Recording important events and experiences |

The most widely accepted explanation is that many paintings depict **shamanic trance experiences**, with the geometric patterns (entoptics) and supernatural scenes representing visions experienced during altered states of consciousness.

## Understanding the Art

### Why Giraffes?

Giraffes don't currently live in Matobo (they prefer flatter terrain), so these paintings tell us:
- Climate/vegetation was different thousands of years ago
- San people traveled to other areas
- Giraffes had spiritual significance
- The paintings are very old

### Painting Techniques

The Nswatugi artists demonstrated skill in:
- **Scale** - Creating life-sized images
- **Proportion** - Accurate animal anatomy
- **Shading** - Some depth techniques
- **Detail** - Distinctive giraffe patterns

### Age Estimates

While difficult to date precisely:
- Likely 2,000-5,000 years old
- Possibly older for some images
- Multiple painting phases visible
- Continuous use over centuries

## Photography Tips

### Challenges

- Low light in cave overhang
- Reflective rock surface
- Distance from paintings
- Crowds at popular times

### Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Low light | Tripod, higher ISO |
| Reflections | Polarizing filter |
| Distance | Telephoto lens (70-200mm) |
| Crowds | Visit early morning |

### Best Shots

1. **Wide view** - Cave setting with paintings
2. **Giraffe detail** - Focus on the famous images
3. **Comparisons** - Person for scale
4. **Details** - Close-ups of technique

<Warning>
**No flash photography** - Flash damages ancient pigments over time. Use available light and tripod for low-light shots.
</Warning>

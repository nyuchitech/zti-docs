# Geological Wonders of Zimbabwe

<img src="/images/geological/balancing-rocks-zimbabwe.jpg" alt="Balancing rocks formation Zimbabwe" />

Zimbabwe sits on some of the oldest rocks on Earth - the ancient Zimbabwean Craton, formed over 2.5 billion years ago. This geological heritage has created a landscape of extraordinary natural sculptures, mysterious caves, and rock formations that seem to defy physics.

<Info>
**Ancient Landscape** - The granite kopjes and balancing rocks you see today have been shaped over millions of years through a process of spheroidal weathering, creating formations found nowhere else on Earth.

## Types of Geological Features

### Balancing Rocks (Dwalas)

Zimbabwe's most iconic geological features are the **balancing rocks** - massive boulders perched precariously on seemingly impossible bases. These formations are so important they appear on Zimbabwe's currency.

**How They Form:**
1. Granite bedrock is fractured by heat/cooling cycles
2. Water seeps into cracks, causing chemical weathering
3. Rounded boulders form underground (spheroidal weathering)
4. Erosion exposes the boulders over millions of years
5. Softer rock erodes away, leaving balanced formations

**Famous Examples:**
- **Epworth Balancing Rocks** - Featured on Zimbabwean currency
- **Domboshava** - Dramatic formations near Harare
- **Matobo Hills** - Thousands of balanced formations
- **Ngomakurira** - Spectacular mountain of balanced rocks

### Granite Kopjes

**Kopjes** (from Afrikaans, pronounced "copy") are small hills or outcrops of rock. Zimbabwe's granite kopjes are:
- Often dome-shaped
- Covered with balanced boulders
- Important wildlife habitats
- Frequently sites of rock art
- Sacred in many traditions

### Caves and Rock Shelters

Zimbabwe has numerous caves formed through:
- Dissolution of limestone (Chinhoyi)
- Weathering of granite (rock shelters)
- Tectonic activity

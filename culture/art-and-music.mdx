<Tip>
  **Art & Music Tip**: When visiting sculpture parks or studios, go in the morning hours when artists are often working. Not only will you get to see the creative process, but many sculptors are more willing to discuss their techniques and inspirations while working. This creates a more meaningful connection than simply purchasing finished pieces.
</Tip>

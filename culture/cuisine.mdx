## Traditional Staples and Dishes

### Staple Foods

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sadza" icon="bowl-food">
    The foundation of Zimbabwean cuisine, sadza is a thick porridge made from ground maize (cornmeal) known locally as "mealie-meal." Similar to polenta but with a thicker consistency, sadza is eaten daily in most Zimbabwean households.

    **How it's eaten**: Rolled into a small ball with the right hand, then dipped into relishes or stews. It serves as both utensil and staple food.

    **Varieties**:

    * White sadza (refined maize meal) - most common

    * Sadza rezviyo (finger millet) - traditional variant with earthy flavor

    * Yellow sadza (sorghum-based) - less common but nutritionally rich
  </Card>

  <Card title="Vegetables and Relishes" icon="carrot">
    Accompanying sadza is always a relish or stew called "usavi," which can be made from:

    * **Muriwo/Delele**: Leafy greens similar to collards or kale, often cooked with tomatoes, onions, and peanut butter

    * **Nyevhe**: Spider flower/spider wisp leaves

    * **Derere**: Okra, often prepared with a slimy texture that locals appreciate

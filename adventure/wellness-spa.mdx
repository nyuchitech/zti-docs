# Wellness & Spa Guide

Zimbabwe offers unique wellness experiences that combine world-class spa treatments with the healing power of nature. From luxurious lodge spas overlooking waterholes to yoga sessions with the sounds of the African bush, wellness in Zimbabwe is unlike anywhere else.

<Note>
**Safari Wellness:** The safari experience itself is inherently restorative—disconnecting from technology, immersing in nature, and following natural rhythms of dawn and dusk. Many visitors find safari to be profoundly rejuvenating even without formal spa treatments.

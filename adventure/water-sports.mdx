    * Professional operators with decades of experience
    * Comprehensive safety briefings
    * Experienced guides (certified, emergency trained)
    * Safety kayakers monitor each raft
    * Rescue equipment throughout

    **Common Events:**
    * **Flips:** Rafts do flip (part of experience)
    * **Swims:** You will likely swim at some point
    * **"Yard Sales":** Everyone out of raft (happens)
    * **"Rocky Rollercoaster":** Bouncing off rocks in raft

    **Real Risks:**
    * Bruises and scrapes (very common)
    * Being "Maytagged" (held underwater in hole - usually brief)
    * Separated from raft (guides retrieve you)
    * Hitting rocks (usually minor)
    * Serious injury (rare but possible - broken bones, shoulder dislocations)
    * Drowning (extremely rare with modern safety)

    **Risk Mitigation:**
    * **Listen to briefing carefully**
    * **Follow guide commands immediately**
    * **"Swim aggressively"** if you fall out (away from raft/rocks)
    * **Point feet downstream** when swimming
    * **Don't try to stand** in moving water
    * **Stay with raft** after flip (don't let go of safety rope)
    * **Trust your life jacket** (it will float you)
    * **Stay calm** (panic is most dangerous)

    **What If:**
    * **Flip:** Hold onto raft safety rope, guides will right it
    * **Swim:** Float feet-first, swim toward shore/safety kayak
    * **Trapped in hole:** Curl into ball, let current push you out bottom

    * **Injury:** Guides carry first aid, will stabilize and evacuate

    **Medical Concerns:**
    * Some risk of bilharzia (schistosomiasis) from river water
    * Many rafters raft without issue, but risk exists
    * Consult doctor if developing symptoms post-trip
    * Antimalarial medication recommended

    **The Gorge:**
    * Steep climb out (200m vertical, ~500 steps)
    * Take your time, use handrails

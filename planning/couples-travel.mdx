## Real Honeymoon Stories

<Card>
**Emma & David, UK - 12 Day Honeymoon:**
"We did Victoria Falls, Hwange, Mana Pools, and a Kariba houseboat. Every day was an adventure. The lodges were unbelievably romantic - baths under stars, dinners by the river, waking to elephants outside our tent. Worth every penny. Friends are now booking Zimbabwe honeymoons after seeing our photos!"

**Maya & James, USA - Adventure Honeymoon:**
"We rafted the Zambezi, walked with elephants in Mana Pools, and did a walking safari in Hwange. It was thrilling and romantic in ways a beach never could be. We grew closer through shared adventures. Best decision to skip the typical beach honeymoon."

**Sophie & Tom, Australia - Budget Luxury:**
"We had $6,000 for 10 days including flights. Mixed budget and splurge stays. Two nights at Somalisa (our splurge) were magical, but honestly the budget camps were also amazing. Zimbabwe gives incredible experiences at all price levels."

**Priya & Raj, India - Extended Luxury:**
"Two weeks of pure indulgence. Private guides, top lodges, spoiled rotten. Yes, it was expensive, but for a once-in-a-lifetime honeymoon, no regrets. Zimbabwe delivered romance and adventure beyond our dreams."

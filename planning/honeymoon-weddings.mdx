## Legal Requirements

### Getting Legally Married in Zimbabwe

<Card title="Legal Requirements" icon="file-contract">

**For Legal Marriage:**
- Both parties must be at least 18 years old
- Valid passports required
- Birth certificates (certified copies)
- Affidavits confirming single status
- If divorced: decree absolute
- If widowed: death certificate
- Letter of no impediment from home country (some countries)
- Minimum 3 working days notice required

**Process:**
1. Submit documents to Registrar's Office (typically in Victoria Falls or nearest town)
2. Pay required fees (approximately $50-100)
3. Wait 3 working days minimum
4. Civil ceremony at Registrar's Office
5. Optional: Additional blessing/ceremony at your chosen venue

**Important Notes:**
- Civil ceremony is the legal component—must happen at Registrar's Office
- Your scenic ceremony can be a "blessing" or symbolic ceremony
- Wedding planners can facilitate the paperwork
- Allow extra time for bureaucracy

**Alternative Approach:**
Many couples marry legally at home and have a blessing ceremony in Zimbabwe. This is simpler and just as romantic—you get your stunning Zimbabwe wedding without the paperwork hassle.

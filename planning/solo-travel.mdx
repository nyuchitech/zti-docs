**Sarah, 28, UK - 3 Weeks Solo:**
"I was terrified before arriving in Victoria Falls, but within 2 hours at the hostel I'd joined 4 others for a sunset cruise and we ended up traveling together for a week. When I wanted solo time, I'd just say so and everyone respected that. Zimbabwe solo was easier than Europe honestly."

"Traveling solo let me go at my own pace. Some days I'd join group activities, other days I'd hire a private guide just for myself. The flexibility was incredible. Cost wasn't much more than my usual vacations once I shared safari costs with others I met."

**Jennifer, 52, Australia - 10 Days Post-Divorce:**
"Best decision I ever made. I'd never traveled alone before and was nervous, but Zimbabwe was the perfect place to start. People were so warm and welcoming. I felt safe the entire time and came home with new friends from three continents."

**James, 24, South Africa - Budget Backpacker:**
"Did 2 weeks on $600 excluding activities. Camped, hitched some rides, cooked at hostels, made amazing friends. Solo travel in Zimbabwe is totally doable on a tiny budget if you're flexible and social."

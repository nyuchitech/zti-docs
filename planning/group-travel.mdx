## Group Travel FAQs

**Q: How many is too many for a group trip?**
A: 6-12 is ideal. Under 6, limited savings. Over 12, logistics challenging. For 12+, consider splitting into sub-groups with flexible coordination.

**Q: Should we all be together constantly?**
A: No! Build in group activities (dinners, major experiences) but allow free time and optional activities. Everyone needs space sometimes.

**Q: How do we handle different budgets?**
A: Core itinerary affordable for all, optional upgrades for those wanting. Split shared costs (vehicle, guide) equally. Individual choices (accommodation upgrades, activities) paid separately.

**Q: What if someone can't afford the trip?**
A: Be sensitive. Consider: lower-cost alternative itinerary, payment plans, group helping with some costs (birthday/special occasion), or accepting smaller group.

**Q: How far in advance for large groups?**
A: 6-12 months minimum for groups of 8+. Exclusive-use lodges and large accommodations book early. Flights also cheaper when booked far ahead.

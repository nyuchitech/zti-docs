## Safari Areas & Hunting Concessions

<Card>
**Safari Areas:**

Zimbabwe has 14 designated Safari Areas surrounding national parks where controlled hunting and photographic safaris occur:

**Purpose:**
* Buffer zones between parks and communal lands
* Controlled hunting generates conservation revenue
* Protects corridors for wildlife movement
* Reduces human-wildlife conflict

**Photographic Safaris:**
* Many safari areas also host non-hunting lodges
* Often less crowded than national parks
* Can offer excellent wildlife viewing
* Private concessions with exclusive access

**Hunting:**
* Strictly regulated by ZimParks
* Quotas based on scientific population management
* Controversial but significant conservation funding source
* Professional hunters must be licensed
* CITES regulations strictly enforced

**Examples:**
* Chewore, Dande, Sapi Safari Areas (near Mana Pools)
* Deka Safari Area (near Hwange)
* Sengwe Corridor (connecting Gonarezhou to South Africa)

## CAMPFIRE Program

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="What is CAMPFIRE?">
    **Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources**

    **Concept:**
    * Communities living near wildlife areas benefit from conservation
    * Revenue from safari tourism and controlled hunting goes to communities
    * Incentivizes conservation over poaching or habitat conversion
    * Communities become stewards of wildlife

    **How It Works:**
    * Rural districts manage wildlife on communal lands
    * Lease hunting quotas and photographic safari rights
    * Revenue funds community projects (schools, clinics, infrastructure)
    * Employs local people as guides, scouts, and in tourism
    * Compensation for crop damage and livestock loss

    **Success:**
    * Pioneering model copied globally
    * Wildlife populations increased in CAMPFIRE areas
    * Reduced poaching in participating communities
    * Generated millions in community revenue

    **Challenges:**
    * Revenue distribution sometimes unequal
    * Human-wildlife conflict remains issue
    * Administrative capacity varies
    * Economic fluctuations affect hunting revenue

    **Tourist Impact:**
    * Staying at community-run lodges supports CAMPFIRE
    * Safari fees in communal areas benefit locals
    * Demonstrates conservation's value to communities

Zimbabwe is one of Africa's premier wildlife destinations, home to exceptional populations of iconic species and over 680 bird species. From the legendary Big Five to rare African wild dogs and spectacular birdlife, Zimbabwe's diverse ecosystems support an extraordinary array of wildlife.

## The Big Five

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="African Elephant" icon="elephant">
    **Population:** ~82,000+ (one of Africa's largest populations)

    **Where to See:** Hwange National Park (45,000+), Mana Pools, Gonarezhou, Matusadona

    **Best Time:** Dry season (May-October) when they congregate at waterholes

    **Behavior:** Highly intelligent and social, living in matriarchal herds. Bulls often solitary or in bachelor groups. Can consume 150kg of vegetation daily.

    **Safety:** Maintain 30+ meter distance. Never position between mother and calf. Watch for ear flapping, trunk raising, and mock charges as warning signs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Lion" icon="paw">
    **Population:** ~1,700-2,000 (stable and healthy)

    **Where to See:** Hwange, Mana Pools, Gonarezhou, Matobo Hills

    **Best Time:** Year-round, but easier to spot in dry season (June-October)

    **Behavior:** Social cats living in prides of 3-30 individuals. Primarily nocturnal hunters, but active at dawn and dusk. Males defend territory while females do most hunting.

    **Viewing Tips:** Look for them near waterholes at dawn and dusk. Listen for roaring at night. Tree-climbing lions can be seen in some areas.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Leopard" icon="cat">
    **Population:** ~2,000+ (elusive but widespread)

    **Where to See:** Mana Pools, Matobo Hills, Hwange, Matusadona

    **Best Time:** Night drives (where permitted), early morning, late evening

    **Behavior:** Solitary and nocturnal. Excellent climbers, often dragging prey into trees to protect from scavengers. Most adaptable of big cats.

    **Viewing Tips:** Scan tree branches for resting leopards or cached prey. Look for alarm calls from baboons and birds. Night drives offer best opportunities.
  </Card>

  <Card title="African Buffalo" icon="buffalo">
    **Population:** ~55,000+ across reserves

    **Where to See:** Hwange, Mana Pools, Gonarezhou, Chizarira

    **Best Time:** Dry season at waterholes; wet season in large herds

    **Behavior:** Live in herds of hundreds to thousands. Adult males may form bachelor groups or become solitary ("dagga boys"). Considered one of Africa's most dangerous animals.

    **Safety:** Extremely dangerous when wounded or protecting calves. Keep distance of 50+ meters. Never approach solitary bulls.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Black & White Rhino" icon="shield">
    **Population:** Small but increasing (exact numbers kept confidential for anti-poaching)

    **Where to See:** Intensive Protection Zones in Mana Pools, Matobo Hills (white rhino walks available), private conservancies

    **Conservation Status:** Critically endangered (black), near threatened (white)

    **Behavior:** Black rhinos are browsers with hooked lips; white rhinos are grazers with square lips. Both have poor eyesight but excellent hearing and smell.

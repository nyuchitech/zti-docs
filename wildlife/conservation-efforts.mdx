    While Zimbabwe has fared better than some African countries, poaching remains a serious threat.

    **Primary Targets:**
    * **Rhinos:** Horn valued for traditional medicine (Asia), dagger handles (Yemen)
    * **Elephants:** Ivory for carvings and ornaments (mainly Asian markets)
    * **Pangolins:** Scales for traditional medicine, meat as delicacy
    * **Leopards:** Skins for traditional ceremonies
    * **Wildlife for bushmeat:** Indiscriminate snaring

    **Methods:**
    * Sophisticated syndicates with international networks
    * Firearms (AK-47s often from conflict zones)
    * Poisoning (cyanide in water holes - devastating for vultures)
    * Wire snares (indiscriminate, cruel, kill all species)
    * Bow and arrow (silent, difficult to detect)

    **Counter-Poaching Efforts:**
    * **Rangers:** Over 1,000 rangers patrolling parks (poorly paid but dedicated)
    * **Technology:** Drones, camera traps, motion sensors, thermal imaging
    * **K9 Units:** Sniffer dogs detect ivory, weapons, poachers
    * **Intelligence:** Community informant networks
    * **Prosecution:** Stiffer penalties including life sentences
    * **Demand Reduction:** Campaigns in consumer countries

    **Funding Challenges:**
    * Ranger salaries often delayed
    * Equipment shortages (vehicles, radios, boots)
    * Technology expensive to acquire and maintain
    * Conservation competes with other national priorities

    **How Tourism Helps:**
    * Park fees directly fund ranger patrols
    * Lodges often employ private security supplementing rangers

    * **Predators:** Livestock killing (lions, leopards, hyenas, wild dogs)
    * **Buffalo:** Crop damage, disease transmission (corridor disease)
    * **Hippos:** Crop raiding at night, human fatalities
    * **Crocodiles:** Attacks on people, livestock at water sources
    * **Primates:** Crop raiding (baboons especially problematic)

    **Consequences:**
    * Economic losses for communities (crops, livestock)
    * Human injuries and fatalities
    * Retaliatory killing of wildlife (poisoning, shooting)
    * Community resentment toward conservation

    **Mitigation Efforts:**
    * **CAMPFIRE Program:** Communities benefit financially from wildlife
    * **Problem Animal Control:** ZimParks responds to conflict situations

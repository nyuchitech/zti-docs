## Introducing Zimbabwe

<Info>
**At a Glance**
- **Location**: Southern Africa, bordered by Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia
- **Capital**: Harare
- **Population**: Approximately 15 million
- **Languages**: English, Shona, Ndebele (plus 13 other recognized languages)
- **Currency**: Multi-currency system (USD widely accepted)
- **Time Zone**: Central Africa Time (UTC+2)
</Info>

Zimbabwe—meaning "House of Stone" in Shona—is a landlocked nation in southern Africa that punches far above its weight when it comes to natural wonders, wildlife, and cultural heritage. Named after the ancient stone city of Great Zimbabwe, this country carries a legacy of powerful African civilizations that flourished centuries before European contact.

From the thundering spray of Victoria Falls to the elephant-studded plains of Hwange, from the misty peaks of the Eastern Highlands to the baobab-dotted wilderness of Gonarezhou, Zimbabwe offers landscapes and experiences that are distinctly its own. The country sits on a high central plateau, giving it a surprisingly moderate climate and creating diverse ecosystems that support some of Africa's most abundant wildlife.

### The Zimbabwe Difference

Many visitors arrive expecting "just another African safari" and leave transformed. What makes the difference?

- **Expert guides**: Zimbabwe has some of the most rigorously trained professional guides in Africa, with licensing standards that are among the highest on the continent
- **Uncrowded wilderness**: Experience game drives and walking safaris where you might be the only vehicle or group in sight
- **Diverse landscapes**: Safari plains, mountain highlands, river valleys, and ancient forests—all within one country
- **Living culture**: This isn't a museum. Shona sculpture, mbira music, and traditional crafts are vibrant contemporary arts, not relics
